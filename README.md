Developed a full-stack doctor-patient appointment booking web app using Node.js and modern frontend technologies. Key features include Google Calendar integration for scheduling, secure authentication with JWT/sessions, and role-based access control. Implemented user-friendly UIs for registration, login, and dashboards. Data is persisted using MongoDB/PostgreSQL. Additional features include notifications, rescheduling, and doctor search. Focused on code clarity, security, and functional robustness over design aesthetics.

- **Frontend:** Any modern framework (React, Angular, or Vue.js)
- **Database:** MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- **Integration:** Google Calendar API

---

### 🔧 Backend Development

- RESTful API with Node.js & Express
- Routes for:
